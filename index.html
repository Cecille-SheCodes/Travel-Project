            <h2>About Bishkek & Kyrgystan</h2>
            <h3>Бишкек formerly Pishpek and Frunze</h3>
            <p>
              Beautifully situated at the foot of huge snowcapped Western Tien
              Shan mountains at an elevation of 800 meters, Bishkek is a former
              Soviet city with a mellow, friendly atmosphere, lots of trees,
              large parks, wide avenues, and monumental squares with World War
              II monuments. The Kyrgyz Republic is located in the northeastern
              part of Central Asia, occupies the western part of the Tien Shan
              mountain system and the northern mountainous regions of the
              Pamir-Alai. More than 80% of the republic's territory is located
              at an altitude of more than 1,500 meters above sea level.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Kyrgyz, an ethnic group known in Central Asia already in the
              first millennium BC, have conveyed their identity and culture
              through the centuries to the present day. Certain objects of
              intangible cultural heritage, such as the trilogy of the epic
              “Manas”, the traditional dwelling of nomadic peoples “Yurt”, types
              of felt carpet “Shyrdak” and “Ala kiyiz” are included in the
              UNESCO World Heritage List.
